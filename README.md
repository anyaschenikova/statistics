# statistics

## Description:
* ```stat_lab_1.ipynb```: 
  1. Explore the relationship between time series;
  2. Conduct a series analysis.
  3. Build ARMAX model, VAR model, VEC model

* ```stat_lab_2.ipynb```: 
  1. Build MMWR_week regression from other parameters and Series_Complete_Pop_Pct regression from other factors
  2. bring data statistics
  3. correlation matrix
  4. scatter charts
  5. confidence intervals for coefficients
  6. check for heteroscedasticity
  7. check the need to build 2 or more regressions (heterogeneous dependence)
  8. Show regression metrics compare linear and non-linear regressions


* ```stat_lab_3.ipynb```: 
  1. ARIMA models for ads.csv and currency.csv datasets

* ```stat_lab_4.ipynb```:
